# Defenders-of-H6
Project for XP

Story
------
As an school project we tried to create perfect code, code without any bugs, which we thought is impossible. After many lost years, suddenly, at one night we were successful. First bug free code that will change the world ! We were shacking our hands and pop champagne, but something wrong was going  to happen. 

As we started compiling our code, we saw tiny bug approaching to our bug-free code to interrupt compiling. 
So we stopped him. 

Then more and more of them start coming. We didn’t expect it. We need to defend the code before they prevents it from compiling. But don’t worry.

We will safe it and maybe save the universe!!
